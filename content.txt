To whom it may concern,

My facebook account rrmsprop@outlook.com is disabled. However, I haven't sent anything via facebook, and I provided my actual information when I registered it. I live in China and am using a VPN each time I access facebook, so I believe it's a misjudge due to my frequently changed IP. I am writing to reactivate my account. Thanks!
